Their eyes met, and Harry felt something like recognition pass between them. Not of each other, but of a shared understanding of the nature of this place and the violence it had just witnessed.\n\nThe prophet's face was impassive, but his eyes burned with an intensity that made Harry's skin crawl. He raised the staff again, and Harry instinctively ducked, though the blast of energy was not aimed at him. It struck the ground between them, sending up a geyser of stone and dust that momentarily obscured the prophet's form.\n\nWhen the dust settled, the prophet was advancing toward Harry, his staff now lowered but still crackling with residual energy. His movements were deliberate, almost ceremonial, as if he were performing some ancient ritual rather than committing mass murder.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the prophet asked, his voice deep and resonant, carrying easily across the chamber despite the chaos around them.\n\nHarry's mind raced. He could lie, but something told him this man—if man he was—would see through any deception. And besides, he had questions of his own.\n\n\"I'm Harry D'Amour,\" he said, straightening up. \"I came looking for answers.\"\n\nThe prophet's lips curled into something that might have been a smile, though it held no warmth. \"And what answers do you seek, Harry D'Amour?\"\n\n\"About the sea,\" Harry said, nodding toward the sliver of darkness that still stood open behind him. \"About Quiddity.\"\n\nThe prophet's eyes flickered toward the opening, and for a moment his face softened with what looked like longing. But it passed quickly, replaced by a cold resolve.\n\n\"You would return there?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Harry said honestly. \"I just want to understand what it is.\"\n\nThe prophet took another step closer, and Harry could smell the blood on him now, mingling with the salt air that still wafted from the opening.\n\n\"You cannot understand,\" the prophet said. \"Not truly. You are of the world. You are of the flesh.\"\n\n\"And you're not?\" Harry challenged, though he felt a tremor of fear as he spoke.\n\nThe prophet's eyes narrowed slightly. \"I was once,\" he said. \"As were they.\" He gestured to the fallen bodies around them. \"But we chose to return. To remember.\"\n\n\"And what",

Their eyes met, and Harry felt something like a cold hand press against his chest. The prophet's face was utterly without expression, as if he were performing some necessary but tedious task.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Harry said, his voice hoarse.\n\nThe prophet did not answer immediately. Instead, he raised his staff again, and another gout of fire leapt from it, this time aimed at Harry. He had only a moment to react, throwing himself sideways as the flame passed through the space where he'd been standing. It struck the wall behind him, and the brickwork melted like wax.\n\nHarry rolled to his feet, his heart hammering. The prophet was already moving toward him, his staff raised for another strike. Harry had no weapon to match this power, no defense against the fire. He could only run.\n\nHe darted between the writhing bodies of the dying, their blood slick beneath his bare feet. The prophet followed, his pace unhurried, as if he knew Harry could not escape. And perhaps he was right. The chamber was growing darker by the second as the Borealis collapsed, and the exits were becoming harder to distinguish.\n\nHarry glanced back once, and saw the prophet's face clearly in the dying light. It was not a face he recognized, but there was something familiar in the set of the jaw, the angle of the brow. It was a face he'd seen before, in photographs perhaps, or in dreams.\n\nThe realization struck him with almost physical force. This was the man from the photographs in Grillo's office—the one who'd supposedly died in the fire at the Reef.\n\nBut that was impossible. Grillo had confirmed it himself. The man was dead.\n\nYet here he stood, alive and killing with terrible ease.\n\nHarry's mind raced as he dodged between the bodies. If this was the same man, then what had happened at the Reef? Had he somehow survived? Or was this some kind of trick, some kind of illusion?\n\nThe prophet raised his staff again, and Harry threw himself behind a fallen body just as another gout of fire passed overhead. The corpse he'd used for cover was still warm, its wounds fresh and smoking.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Harry shouted again, his voice echoing in the chamber.\n\nThe prophet paused, his staff still raised. \"You don't know?\" he asked,",

They were too deep, too knowing, too certain of their own authority. They had seen too much, and done too much, to be anything but the eyes of a god.\n\nThe prophet raised his staff, and Harry felt the air thicken around him, as though the very atmosphere was being compressed into a weapon. He had only a moment to react before the prophet released his power.\n\nHarry threw himself sideways, and the blast that had been meant for his chest instead struck the ground where he'd stood, sending a shockwave through the chamber. The floor buckled beneath him, and he rolled with the motion, coming up against the wall as the prophet advanced, his staff now lowered, as if he had no need of it for this kill.\n\n\"You shouldn't be here,\" the prophet said, his words carrying across the distance between them. \"This is not your place.\"\n\nHarry didn't answer. He was too busy trying to gauge the prophet's speed. The man moved with an unnatural grace, as if he were lighter than air, or heavier than stone. Either way, he was faster than Harry.\n\n\"You're not one of them,\" the prophet continued, gesturing vaguely at the fallen exiles. \"I can smell it on you. You're human.\"\n\nHarry's fingers brushed the butt of his gun. He didn't draw it yet. Not yet.\n\n\"You're not afraid,\" the prophet observed, tilting his head slightly. \"That's interesting.\"\n\n\"I'm not stupid,\" Harry replied. \"I know when I'm outmatched.\"\n\nThe prophet smiled, a thin, humorless expression. \"You think you are?\"\n\n\"I know I am.\"\n\n\"Then why are you still standing?\"\n\nHarry shrugged. \"I'm curious.\"\n\nThe prophet's smile widened, just a fraction. \"Curiosity killed the cat.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, I'm not a cat.\"\n\n\"No,\" the prophet said, taking another step forward. \"You're something else.

He was too busy trying to keep his bowels from emptying.\n\nThe prophet took a step towards him, and the staff in his hand spat another burst of fire. It struck the ground between them, and the floor beneath Harry's feet began to crack. He stumbled back, but the fissure followed him, splitting the stone as he retreated.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the prophet said again, and this time Harry found his voice.\n\n\"I'm nobody,\" he said.\n\nThe prophet's face twitched into something that might have been a smile. \"Nobody,\" he said. \"That's a good answer. Nobody is exactly what I'm looking for.\"\n\nHarry glanced to his right. The edge of the chamber was twenty feet away, and the stairs beyond it. But the prophet was between him and the exit, and the staff in his hand was still spitting fire.\n\n\"Come here,\" the prophet said.\n\nHarry shook his head.\n\n\"Come here,\" the prophet repeated, and this time the command was not a request. It was a summons, and Harry felt his body beginning to move against his will.\n\n\"No,\" he said, but his legs were already carrying him forward.\n\n\"Good,\" the prophet said. \"Now kneel.\"\n\nHarry's knees hit the stone floor before he could stop them. His body was no longer his to command.\n\n\"Look at me,\" the prophet said.\n\nHarry raised his eyes. The prophet's face was inches from his now, and the eyes that had so terrified him were even more terrible at this proximity. They were not just inhuman; they were anti-human. They were the eyes of a thing that had never known the comfort of a human face.\n\n\"Now,\" the prophet said, \"tell me your name.\"\n\nHarry opened his mouth to lie, but the truth came out instead. \"Harry,\" he said.\n\n\"Harry,\" the prophet repeated, as though tasting the name. \"Harry D'Amour.\"\n\nHarry felt a shudder run through him.

He threw himself sideways, the heat of the blast passing so close to his face that it singed the hair on his left temple. He hit the ground hard, the impact driving the breath from his lungs. As he lay there, gasping, he saw the prophet advancing towards him, his staff raised for another strike.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the prophet said, his words thick with some accent Harry couldn't place.\n\nHarry didn't answer. He rolled onto his back, his hand already reaching for the gun in his holster. But before he could draw it, the prophet was upon him, his staff descending. Harry caught hold of it with both hands, stopping it just inches from his face. The heat from the weapon was unbearable, and the metal of the barrel was burning his palms.\n\n\"You're not one of them,\" the prophet said, his face inches from Harry's. His breath smelled of something sweet and rotten, like overripe fruit. \"You're not one of them.\"\n\nHarry tried to wrench the staff from his grip, but the prophet was too strong. He pressed down harder, the heat from the weapon intensifying. Harry's skin blistered.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the prophet demanded again.\n\nHarry's vision was starting to blur from the pain. He could feel the flesh of his palms beginning to char.\n\n\"I'm the one who's going to kill you,\" he gasped.\n\nThe prophet's face contorted into something almost amused. \"You?\" he said. \"You're going to kill me?\"\n\nHarry's grip was failing. His hands were beginning to smoke.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" the prophet said, and pressed down harder.\n\nHarry screamed as the staff burned through his palms, the agony so intense it seemed to be coming from somewhere deeper than his flesh, from the marrow of his bones. His fingers spasmed open, releasing the staff, and the prophet wrenched it free, raising it for a killing blow.\n\nBut before he could strike, a voice called out from the darkness.\n\n\"Stop!\"\n\nThe prophet hesitated, his staff hovering above Harry's face.\n\n\"Don't kill him,\" the voice said. \"He's not one of them.\"\n\nThe prophet turned his head slightly, as though listening to some instruction Harry couldn't hear.\n\n\"Kill him,\" the",

The man turned his head, his gaze finding Harry in the gloom. His face was a mask of calm, his eyes—one blue, one brown—showing no surprise at Harry's presence.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Harry said, backing away as the man began to advance.\n\nThe man's smile was slow in coming, but when it did it was terrible to see. \"I am the blessing,\" he said.\n\nHarry fired again, and this time the bullet found its mark, striking the man in the chest. He staggered, but did not fall. Instead, he looked down at the wound, and as Harry watched, the hole in his robes began to knit itself shut.\n\n\"Oh, Christ,\" Harry said, backing away.\n\nThe man's smile widened. \"You know me, don't you?\" he said, his words almost gentle. \"You've seen my face before.\"\n\nHarry had indeed. It was the same face that had been on the bed in Wyckoff Street, the same face that had sat on his chest in the Loop, the same face that had haunted his dreams ever since.\n\n\"You're dead,\" Harry said.\n\n\"I was,\" the man replied, \"but I'm not now.\"\n\nHe raised his staff, and Harry fired again, but this time the bullet struck the staff itself, and the impact sent a shock up Harry's arm. The man didn't even flinch. He simply pointed the staff at Harry, and a gout of fire came from it, striking Harry in the chest. The heat was immediate and merciless, and Harry was thrown back against the wall, his flesh seared. He screamed, the sound torn from him as the fire ate into his skin, but even as he screamed he was aware of the tattoos on his body, writhing in protest, trying to shield him from the worst of the damage.\n\nThe man came closer, his face now inches from Harry's. \"You're marked,\" he said, studying the tattoos. \"You've been trying to protect yourself, haven't you?\" He reached out and touched the freshest of the marks, the one on Harry's arm. \"This one's new. It's still tender, yes?\"\n\nHarry tried to speak, but the pain was too great. He could only nod.\n\n\"Good,\" the man",

It was not the look of a man who had just slaughtered a dozen of his fellows, but of one who had done it a thousand times before, and would do it a thousand times again. His face was a mask of indifference, his eyes like chips of ice.\n\nHarry had no time to retreat. The prophet was already raising his staff, and the fire was already coming, a slow, deliberate stream of it, as though he had all the time in the world to kill Harry.\n\nThe fire struck Harry in the chest, and the pain was beyond anything he had ever known. It was not just the agony of burning flesh, but the agony of being unmade. His skin peeled away from his ribs, his ribs from his heart, his heart from his soul. He felt himself dissolving, and yet he did not die. The fire had not been meant to kill him, but to test him. And he passed the test, because as the flames licked at his core, he did not scream. He did not beg. He simply endured, and in that endurance found a kind of strength.\n\nThe prophet lowered his staff, and the fire died. Harry stood before him, his chest a ruin of charred flesh, but still standing.\n\nThe prophet spoke, his words like the crack of ice.\n\n“You are not of the Zyem Carasophia,” he said.\n\nHarry said nothing. He was too busy trying to breathe through the pain.\n\nThe prophet stepped closer, his staff still in his hand. The fire had not quite died from it, but was still coiling around the wood like a serpent.\n\n“You are not of the Zyem Carasophia,” he repeated.\n\nHarry found his voice. It was hoarse, but it came.\n\n“No,” he said.\n\nThe prophet studied him, his gaze moving from Harry’s face to his chest, where the fire had done its work.\n\n“You are marked,” he said.\n\nHarry nodded. He had no choice but to agree.\n\nThe prophet reached out with his free hand and touched Harry’s chest. The contact was not gentle. His fingers pressed into the charred flesh, and Harry felt the pain of it anew, but he did not flinch.\n\n“You are marked by the Iad,” the prophet said.\n\nHarry nodded again.\n\nThe prophet",

It struck the wall behind him, and the brickwork exploded in a shower of shrapnel.\n\nHarry was already moving, rolling across the floor, his body a blur of motion. He came up on one knee, his hand already at his holster, and fired three times in quick succession. The first shot went wide, the second struck the prophet in the shoulder, the third in the chest. He staggered back, but did not fall. Instead, he raised his staff again, and this time Harry had no time to dodge. The blast of fire caught him full in the chest, and the pain was so immediate and so absolute that for a moment he thought he was dead. His body was a furnace, his flesh a sheet of agony. He fell back, his gun slipping from his fingers, his vision dimming.\n\nBut he was not dead. He was burning, yes, but not dead. He could still see the prophet advancing on him, still hear the dying screams of the exiles, still feel the heat of the fire that had struck him. He tried to move, but his limbs were leaden with pain. The prophet was now standing over him, his staff raised for the killing blow.\n\nHarry closed his eyes, waiting for the end.\n\nIt did not come. Instead, he heard the prophet speak.\n\n“You are not of them,” the prophet said. His voice was deep and resonant, like the sea itself speaking. “You are not of the Zyem Carasophia. You are not of Quiddity. You are of the world. Why do you come here, to this place of exile, with your weapons and your hatreds? Why do you come to kill us, when we have done you no harm?”\n\nHarry opened his eyes. The prophet was still standing over him, but now he was looking down at Harry with something like curiosity.\n\n“You don’t know who I am, do you?” Harry said.\n\nThe prophet shook his head. “No. But I know what you are.

The eyes were deep-set and dark, the mouth full and red, the beard white as snow. But the face was not the face of a man. It was the face of a god, or a demon, or something that had once been both.\n\nHarry had no time to study it further. The prophet raised his staff, and Harry threw himself sideways, the blast of energy passing through the space where he had stood a moment before. It struck the wall behind him, and the bricks there melted like wax, running down in a cascade of molten stone.\n\nHarry was already moving, rolling across the floor, his body responding to the threat with a speed that was almost supernatural. He came up on his feet, and ran for the stairs, knowing that if he could just get to the top of them, he might have a chance of survival. The prophet was already pursuing him, his staff raised for a killing shot, but Harry reached the stairs and threw himself up them, three at a time, his bare feet slipping on the stone.\n\nBehind him, the prophet spoke, and the sound of his voice was like the breaking of icebergs.\n\n“You are not of the Zyem Carasophia, ” he said.\n\nHarry didn’t stop to answer, but kept climbing, his breath coming in ragged gasps.
