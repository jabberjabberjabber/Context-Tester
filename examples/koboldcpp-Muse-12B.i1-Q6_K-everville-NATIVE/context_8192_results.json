Despite the appalling scale of her wounding, she was not felled, but swung round to face her wounder.\n\n“Why?” she sobbed, extending her flabby arms in his direction. “Why?”\n\nHe made no answer. Simply raised his staff a second time, and let another burst of energy go from it, striking his victim in the mouth. Her pleas ceased on the instant, and the fire climbed up over her skull, turning it to ruin in a heartbeat. Even then she didn’t fall. Her body shook as it stood, her bow",
    "ground_truth_text": "els and bladder voiding. Wearing a look close to amusement, the prophet stepped over the bloody litter that lay between them and with one backhanded swipe struck the seared face with the staff, the blow so hard her head was separated from her neck.\n\nHarry let out an involuntary cry, more of rage than of horror. The killer, who was already striding past the beheaded woman towards the crack, stopped in mid-step, and stared through the blood-flecked air.\n\nHarry froze. The prophet stared on, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\nHe doesn’t see me, Harry thought.\n\nThat was perhaps overly optimistic. The man continued to look, as though he glimpsed some trace of a presence in the deepening darkness, but could not quite decide whether his eyes were deceiving him. He wasn’t about to take any chances. Even as he stared on in puzzlement he raised his staff.\n\nHarry didn’t wait for the fire to come. He made a dash for the stairs, hoping to God that Ted had escaped ahead of him. The killing fire sighed past him, close enough for Harry to feel its sickly heat, then burst against the opposite wall, its energies tracing the cracks as it dispersed. Harry looked back towards the prophet, who had already forgotten about the phantom and had turned towards the dark crack that let on to Quiddity.\n\nHarry’s gaze went to the sliver. In the diminishing light of the chamber the shore and sea were more visible than they had been, and for a moment it was all he could do not to turn back; to race the prophet to the threshold and be out under that steepled sky.\n\nThen, from the murk off to his left, a pained and weary voice.\n\n“I’m sorry, Harry . . . please . . . I’m sorry—”\n\nWith a sickening lurch in his stomach Harry turned and sought out the source of the voice. Ted lay seven or eight yards from the bottom of the stairs, his arms open wide, his chest the same. Such a wound, wet and deep, it was a wonder he had life enough to breathe, much less to speak. Harry went down at his side.\n\n\n\n“Grab my hand, will you?” Ted said.\n\n“I’ve got it,” Harry said.\n\n“I can’t feel anything.”\n\n“Maybe that’s for the best,” Harry said. “I’m going to have to pick you up.”\n\n“He came out of nowhere—”",

It was not a look of recognition, nor of curiosity, but of simple assessment. He was measuring Harry, as one might measure a piece of meat, to see if he was worth the effort of killing.\n\nHarry had no doubt that he was. The prophet's eyes were not human. They were too deep, too knowing, too certain of their own authority. They had seen too much, and done too much, to be anything but the eyes of a god.\n\nThe prophet raised his staff, and Harry felt the air thicken around him, as though the very atmosphere was being compressed into a weapon. He had only a moment to react before the prophet released his power.\n\nHarry threw himself sideways, and the blast that had been meant for his chest instead struck the ground where he'd stood, sending a shockwave through the chamber. The floor buckled beneath him, and he rolled with the motion, coming up against the wall as the prophet advanced, his staff now lowered, as if he had no need of it for this kill.\n\n\"You shouldn't be here,\" the prophet said, his words carrying across the distance between them. \"This is not your place.\"\n\nHarry didn't answer. He was too busy trying to gauge the prophet's speed. The man moved with an unnatural grace, as if he were lighter than air, or heavier than stone. Either way, he was faster than Harry.\n\n\"You're not one of them,\" the prophet continued, gesturing vaguely at the fallen exiles. \"I can smell it on you.

Not yet.\n\n\"You're not afraid,\" the prophet observed, tilting his head slightly. \"That's interesting.\"\n\n\"I'm not stupid,\" Harry replied. \"I know when I'm outmatched.\"\n\nThe prophet smiled, a thin, humorless expression. \"You think you are?\"\n\n\"I know I am.\"\n\n\"Then why are you still standing?\"\n\nHarry shrugged. \"I'm curious.\"\n\nThe prophet's smile widened, just a fraction. \"Curiosity killed the cat.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, I'm not a cat.\"\n\n\"No,\" the prophet said, taking another step forward. \"You're something else.
