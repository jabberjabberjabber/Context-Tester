Despite the appalling scale of her wounding, she was not felled, but swung round to face her wounder.\n\n“Why?” she sobbed, extending her flabby arms in his direction. “Why?”\n\nHe made no answer. Simply raised his staff a second time, and let another burst of energy go from it, striking his victim in the mouth. Her pleas ceased on the instant, and the fire climbed up over her skull, turning it to ruin in a heartbeat. Even then she didn’t fall. Her body shook as it stood, her bow",

Wearing a look close to amusement, the prophet stepped over the bloody litter that lay between them and with one backhanded swipe struck the seared face with the staff, the blow so hard her head was separated from her neck.\n\nHarry let out an involuntary cry, more of rage than of horror. The killer, who was already striding past the beheaded woman towards the crack, stopped in mid-step, and stared through the blood-flecked air.\n\nHarry froze. The prophet stared on, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\nHe doesn’t see me, Harry thought.\n\nThat was perhaps overly optimistic. The man continued to look, as though he glimpsed some trace of a presence in the deepening darkness, but could not quite decide whether his eyes were deceiving him. He wasn’t about to take any chances. Even as he stared on in puzzlement he raised his staff.\n\nHarry didn’t wait for the fire to come. He made a dash for the stairs, hoping to God that Ted had escaped ahead of him. The killing fire sighed past him, close enough for Harry to feel its sickly heat, then burst against the opposite wall, its energies tracing the cracks as it dispersed. Harry looked back towards the prophet, who had already forgotten about the phantom and had turned towards the dark crack that let on to Quiddity.\n\nHarry’s gaze went to the sliver. In the diminishing light of the chamber the shore and sea were more visible than they had been, and for a moment it was all he could do not to turn back; to race the prophet to the threshold and be out under that steepled sky.\n\nThen, from the murk off to his left, a pained and weary voice.\n\n“I’m sorry, Harry . . . please . . . I’m sorry—”\n\nWith a sickening lurch in his stomach Harry turned and sought out the source of the voice. Ted lay seven or eight yards from the bottom of the stairs, his arms open wide, his chest the same. Such a wound, wet and deep, it was a wonder he had life enough to breathe, much less to speak. Harry went down at his side.\n\n\n\n“Grab my hand, will you?” Ted said.\n\n“I’ve got it,” Harry said.\n\n“I can’t feel anything.”\n\n“Maybe that’s for the best,” Harry said. “I’m going to have to pick you up.”\n\n“He came out of nowhere—”",

The man turned his head, his gaze finding Harry in the gloom. His face was a mask of calm, his eyes—one blue, one brown—showing no surprise at Harry's presence.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Harry said, backing away as the man began to advance.\n\nThe man's smile was slow in coming, but when it did it was terrible to see. \"I am the blessing,\" he said.\n\nHarry fired again, and this time the bullet found its mark, striking the man in the chest. He staggered, but did not fall. Instead, he looked down at the wound, and as Harry watched, the hole in his robes began to knit itself shut.\n\n\"Oh, Christ,\" Harry said, backing away.\n\nThe man's smile widened. \"You know me, don't you?\" he said, his words almost gentle. \"You've seen my face before.\"\n\nHarry had indeed. It was the same face that had been on the bed in Wyckoff Street, the same face that had sat on his chest in the Loop, the same face that had haunted his dreams ever since.\n\n\"You're dead,\" Harry said.\n\n\"I was,\" the man replied, \"but I'm not now.\"\n\nHe raised his staff, and Harry fired again, but this time the bullet struck the staff itself, and the impact sent a shock up Harry's arm. The man didn't even flinch. He simply pointed the staff at Harry, and a gout of fire came from it, striking Harry in the chest. The heat was immediate and merciless, and Harry was thrown back against the wall, his flesh seared. He screamed, the sound torn from him as the fire ate into his skin, but even as he screamed he was aware of the tattoos on his body, writhing in protest, trying to shield him from the worst of the damage.\n\nThe man came closer, his face now inches from Harry's. \"You're marked,\" he said, studying the tattoos. \"You've been trying to protect yourself, haven't you?\" He reached out and touched the freshest of the marks, the one on Harry's arm. \"This one's new. It's still tender, yes?\"\n\nHarry tried to speak, but the pain was too great. He could only nod.\n\n\"Good,\" the man",
