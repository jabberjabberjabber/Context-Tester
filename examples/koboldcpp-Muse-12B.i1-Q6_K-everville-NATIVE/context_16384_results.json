Despite the appalling scale of her wounding, she was not felled, but swung round to face her wounder.\n\n“Why?” she sobbed, extending her flabby arms in his direction. “Why?”\n\nHe made no answer. Simply raised his staff a second time, and let another burst of energy go from it, striking his victim in the mouth. Her pleas ceased on the instant, and the fire climbed up over her skull, turning it to ruin in a heartbeat. Even then she didn’t fall. Her body shook as it stood, her bow",
    "ground_truth_text": "els and bladder voiding. Wearing a look close to amusement, the prophet stepped over the bloody litter that lay between them and with one backhanded swipe struck the seared face with the staff, the blow so hard her head was separated from her neck.\n\nHarry let out an involuntary cry, more of rage than of horror. The killer, who was already striding past the beheaded woman towards the crack, stopped in mid-step, and stared through the blood-flecked air.\n\nHarry froze. The prophet stared on, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\nHe doesn’t see me, Harry thought.\n\nThat was perhaps overly optimistic. The man continued to look, as though he glimpsed some trace of a presence in the deepening darkness, but could not quite decide whether his eyes were deceiving him. He wasn’t about to take any chances. Even as he stared on in puzzlement he raised his staff.\n\nHarry didn’t wait for the fire to come. He made a dash for the stairs, hoping to God that Ted had escaped ahead of him. The killing fire sighed past him, close enough for Harry to feel its sickly heat, then burst against the opposite wall, its energies tracing the cracks as it dispersed. Harry looked back towards the prophet, who had already forgotten about the phantom and had turned towards the dark crack that let on to Quiddity.\n\nHarry’s gaze went to the sliver. In the diminishing light of the chamber the shore and sea were more visible than they had been, and for a moment it was all he could do not to turn back; to race the prophet to the threshold and be out under that steepled sky.\n\nThen, from the murk off to his left, a pained and weary voice.\n\n“I’m sorry, Harry . . . please . . . I’m sorry—”\n\nWith a sickening lurch in his stomach Harry turned and sought out the source of the voice. Ted lay seven or eight yards from the bottom of the stairs, his arms open wide, his chest the same. Such a wound, wet and deep, it was a wonder he had life enough to breathe, much less to speak. Harry went down at his side.\n\n\n\n“Grab my hand, will you?” Ted said.\n\n“I’ve got it,” Harry said.\n\n“I can’t feel anything.”\n\n“Maybe that’s for the best,” Harry said. “I’m going to have to pick you up.”\n\n“He came out of nowhere—”",

He threw himself sideways, the heat of the blast passing so close to his face that it singed the hair on his left temple. He hit the ground hard, the impact driving the breath from his lungs. As he lay there, gasping, he saw the prophet advancing towards him, his staff raised for another strike.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the prophet said, his words thick with some accent Harry couldn't place.\n\nHarry didn't answer. He rolled onto his back, his hand already reaching for the gun in his holster. But before he could draw it, the prophet was upon him, his staff descending. Harry caught hold of it with both hands, stopping it just inches from his face. The heat from the weapon was unbearable, and the metal of the barrel was burning his palms.\n\n\"You're not one of them,\" the prophet said, his face inches from Harry's. His breath smelled of something sweet and rotten, like overripe fruit. \"You're not one of them.\"\n\nHarry tried to wrench the staff from his grip, but the prophet was too strong. He pressed down harder, the heat from the weapon intensifying. Harry's skin blistered.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the prophet demanded again.\n\nHarry's vision was starting to blur from the pain. He could feel the flesh of his palms beginning to char.\n\n\"I'm the one who's going to kill you,\" he gasped.\n\nThe prophet's face contorted into something almost amused. \"You?\" he said. \"You're going to kill me?\"\n\nHarry's grip was failing. His hands were beginning to smoke.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" the prophet said, and pressed down harder.\n\nHarry screamed as the staff burned through his palms, the agony so intense it seemed to be coming from somewhere deeper than his flesh, from the marrow of his bones. His fingers spasmed open, releasing the staff, and the prophet wrenched it free, raising it for a killing blow.\n\nBut before he could strike, a voice called out from the darkness.\n\n\"Stop!\"\n\nThe prophet hesitated, his staff hovering above Harry's face.\n\n\"Don't kill him,\" the voice said. \"He's not one of them.\"\n\nThe prophet turned his head slightly, as though listening to some instruction Harry couldn't hear.\n\n\"Kill him,\" the",
