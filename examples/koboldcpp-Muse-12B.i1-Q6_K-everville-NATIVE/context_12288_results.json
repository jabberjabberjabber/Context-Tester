Despite the appalling scale of her wounding, she was not felled, but swung round to face her wounder.\n\n“Why?” she sobbed, extending her flabby arms in his direction. “Why?”\n\nHe made no answer. Simply raised his staff a second time, and let another burst of energy go from it, striking his victim in the mouth. Her pleas ceased on the instant, and the fire climbed up over her skull, turning it to ruin in a heartbeat. Even then she didn’t fall. Her body shook as it stood, her bow",
    "ground_truth_text": "els and bladder voiding. Wearing a look close to amusement, the prophet stepped over the bloody litter that lay between them and with one backhanded swipe struck the seared face with the staff, the blow so hard her head was separated from her neck.\n\nHarry let out an involuntary cry, more of rage than of horror. The killer, who was already striding past the beheaded woman towards the crack, stopped in mid-step, and stared through the blood-flecked air.\n\nHarry froze. The prophet stared on, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\nHe doesn’t see me, Harry thought.\n\nThat was perhaps overly optimistic. The man continued to look, as though he glimpsed some trace of a presence in the deepening darkness, but could not quite decide whether his eyes were deceiving him. He wasn’t about to take any chances. Even as he stared on in puzzlement he raised his staff.\n\nHarry didn’t wait for the fire to come. He made a dash for the stairs, hoping to God that Ted had escaped ahead of him. The killing fire sighed past him, close enough for Harry to feel its sickly heat, then burst against the opposite wall, its energies tracing the cracks as it dispersed. Harry looked back towards the prophet, who had already forgotten about the phantom and had turned towards the dark crack that let on to Quiddity.\n\nHarry’s gaze went to the sliver. In the diminishing light of the chamber the shore and sea were more visible than they had been, and for a moment it was all he could do not to turn back; to race the prophet to the threshold and be out under that steepled sky.\n\nThen, from the murk off to his left, a pained and weary voice.\n\n“I’m sorry, Harry . . . please . . . I’m sorry—”\n\nWith a sickening lurch in his stomach Harry turned and sought out the source of the voice. Ted lay seven or eight yards from the bottom of the stairs, his arms open wide, his chest the same. Such a wound, wet and deep, it was a wonder he had life enough to breathe, much less to speak. Harry went down at his side.\n\n\n\n“Grab my hand, will you?” Ted said.\n\n“I’ve got it,” Harry said.\n\n“I can’t feel anything.”\n\n“Maybe that’s for the best,” Harry said. “I’m going to have to pick you up.”\n\n“He came out of nowhere—”",

They were the eyes of a thing that had never known the comfort of a mother's arms, or the solace of a lover's touch. They were the eyes of a thing that had never known love at all.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the prophet said, his voice like the grinding of stones.\n\nHarry didn't answer. He was too busy trying to keep his bowels from emptying.\n\nThe prophet took a step towards him, and the staff in his hand spat another burst of fire. It struck the ground between them, and the floor beneath Harry's feet began to crack. He stumbled back, but the fissure followed him, splitting the stone as he retreated.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the prophet said again, and this time Harry found his voice.\n\n\"I'm nobody,\" he said.\n\nThe prophet's face twitched into something that might have been a smile. \"Nobody,\" he said. \"That's a good answer. Nobody is exactly what I'm looking for.\"\n\nHarry glanced to his right. The edge of the chamber was twenty feet away, and the stairs beyond it. But the prophet was between him and the exit, and the staff in his hand was still spitting fire.\n\n\"Come here,\" the prophet said.\n\nHarry shook his head.\n\n\"Come here,\" the prophet repeated, and this time the command was not a request. It was a summons, and Harry felt his body beginning to move against his will.\n\n\"No,\" he said, but his legs were already carrying him forward.\n\n\"Good,\" the prophet said. \"Now kneel.\"\n\nHarry's knees hit the stone floor before he could stop them. His body was no longer his to command.\n\n\"Look at me,\" the prophet said.\n\nHarry raised his eyes. The prophet's face was inches from his now, and the eyes that had so terrified him were even more terrible at this proximity. They were not just inhuman; they were anti-human. They were the eyes of a thing that had never known the comfort of a human face.\n\n\"Now,\" the prophet said, \"tell me your name.\"\n\nHarry opened his mouth to lie, but the truth came out instead. \"Harry,\" he said.\n\n\"Harry,\" the prophet repeated, as though tasting the name. \"Harry D'Amour.\"\n\nHarry felt a shudder run through him.
