Despite the appalling scale of her wounding, she was not felled, but swung round to face her wounder.\n\n“Why?” she sobbed, extending her flabby arms in his direction. “Why?”\n\nHe made no answer. Simply raised his staff a second time, and let another burst of energy go from it, striking his victim in the mouth. Her pleas ceased on the instant, and the fire climbed up over her skull, turning it to ruin in a heartbeat. Even then she didn’t fall. Her body shook as it stood, her bow",
    "ground_truth_text": "els and bladder voiding. Wearing a look close to amusement, the prophet stepped over the bloody litter that lay between them and with one backhanded swipe struck the seared face with the staff, the blow so hard her head was separated from her neck.\n\nHarry let out an involuntary cry, more of rage than of horror. The killer, who was already striding past the beheaded woman towards the crack, stopped in mid-step, and stared through the blood-flecked air.\n\nHarry froze. The prophet stared on, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\nHe doesn’t see me, Harry thought.\n\nThat was perhaps overly optimistic. The man continued to look, as though he glimpsed some trace of a presence in the deepening darkness, but could not quite decide whether his eyes were deceiving him. He wasn’t about to take any chances. Even as he stared on in puzzlement he raised his staff.\n\nHarry didn’t wait for the fire to come. He made a dash for the stairs, hoping to God that Ted had escaped ahead of him. The killing fire sighed past him, close enough for Harry to feel its sickly heat, then burst against the opposite wall, its energies tracing the cracks as it dispersed. Harry looked back towards the prophet, who had already forgotten about the phantom and had turned towards the dark crack that let on to Quiddity.\n\nHarry’s gaze went to the sliver. In the diminishing light of the chamber the shore and sea were more visible than they had been, and for a moment it was all he could do not to turn back; to race the prophet to the threshold and be out under that steepled sky.\n\nThen, from the murk off to his left, a pained and weary voice.\n\n“I’m sorry, Harry . . . please . . . I’m sorry—”\n\nWith a sickening lurch in his stomach Harry turned and sought out the source of the voice. Ted lay seven or eight yards from the bottom of the stairs, his arms open wide, his chest the same. Such a wound, wet and deep, it was a wonder he had life enough to breathe, much less to speak. Harry went down at his side.\n\n\n\n“Grab my hand, will you?” Ted said.\n\n“I’ve got it,” Harry said.\n\n“I can’t feel anything.”\n\n“Maybe that’s for the best,” Harry said. “I’m going to have to pick you up.”\n\n“He came out of nowhere—”",

His gaze was terrible to behold, his eyes like twin moons of blood, his face a mask of calm. He raised the staff again, and Harry, knowing he had no time to reach for his gun, threw himself sideways, the blast of fire passing through the space where he had stood a moment before. It struck the wall behind him, and the brickwork exploded in a shower of shrapnel.\n\nHarry was already moving, rolling across the floor, his body a blur of motion. He came up on one knee, his hand already at his holster, and fired three times in quick succession. The first shot went wide, the second struck the prophet in the shoulder, the third in the chest. He staggered back, but did not fall. Instead, he raised his staff again, and this time Harry had no time to dodge. The blast of fire caught him full in the chest, and the pain was so immediate and so absolute that for a moment he thought he was dead. His body was a furnace, his flesh a sheet of agony. He fell back, his gun slipping from his fingers, his vision dimming.\n\nBut he was not dead. He was burning, yes, but not dead. He could still see the prophet advancing on him, still hear the dying screams of the exiles, still feel the heat of the fire that had struck him. He tried to move, but his limbs were leaden with pain. The prophet was now standing over him, his staff raised for the killing blow.\n\nHarry closed his eyes, waiting for the end.\n\nIt did not come. Instead, he heard the prophet speak.\n\n“You are not of them,” the prophet said. His voice was deep and resonant, like the sea itself speaking. “You are not of the Zyem Carasophia. You are not of Quiddity. You are of the world. Why do you come here, to this place of exile, with your weapons and your hatreds? Why do you come to kill us, when we have done you no harm?”\n\nHarry opened his eyes. The prophet was still standing over him, but now he was looking down at Harry with something like curiosity.\n\n“You don’t know who I am, do you?” Harry said.\n\nThe prophet shook his head. “No. But I know what you are.
