Despite the appalling scale of her wounding, she was not felled, but swung round to face her wounder.\n\n“Why?” she sobbed, extending her flabby arms in his direction. “Why?”\n\nHe made no answer. Simply raised his staff a second time, and let another burst of energy go from it, striking his victim in the mouth. Her pleas ceased on the instant, and the fire climbed up over her skull, turning it to ruin in a heartbeat. Even then she didn’t fall. Her body shook as it stood, her bow",
    "ground_truth_text": "els and bladder voiding. Wearing a look close to amusement, the prophet stepped over the bloody litter that lay between them and with one backhanded swipe struck the seared face with the staff, the blow so hard her head was separated from her neck.\n\nHarry let out an involuntary cry, more of rage than of horror. The killer, who was already striding past the beheaded woman towards the crack, stopped in mid-step, and stared through the blood-flecked air.\n\nHarry froze. The prophet stared on, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\nHe doesn’t see me, Harry thought.\n\nThat was perhaps overly optimistic. The man continued to look, as though he glimpsed some trace of a presence in the deepening darkness, but could not quite decide whether his eyes were deceiving him. He wasn’t about to take any chances. Even as he stared on in puzzlement he raised his staff.\n\nHarry didn’t wait for the fire to come. He made a dash for the stairs, hoping to God that Ted had escaped ahead of him. The killing fire sighed past him, close enough for Harry to feel its sickly heat, then burst against the opposite wall, its energies tracing the cracks as it dispersed. Harry looked back towards the prophet, who had already forgotten about the phantom and had turned towards the dark crack that let on to Quiddity.\n\nHarry’s gaze went to the sliver. In the diminishing light of the chamber the shore and sea were more visible than they had been, and for a moment it was all he could do not to turn back; to race the prophet to the threshold and be out under that steepled sky.\n\nThen, from the murk off to his left, a pained and weary voice.\n\n“I’m sorry, Harry . . . please . . . I’m sorry—”\n\nWith a sickening lurch in his stomach Harry turned and sought out the source of the voice. Ted lay seven or eight yards from the bottom of the stairs, his arms open wide, his chest the same. Such a wound, wet and deep, it was a wonder he had life enough to breathe, much less to speak. Harry went down at his side.\n\n\n\n“Grab my hand, will you?” Ted said.\n\n“I’ve got it,” Harry said.\n\n“I can’t feel anything.”\n\n“Maybe that’s for the best,” Harry said. “I’m going to have to pick you up.”\n\n“He came out of nowhere—”",

It was not the look of a man who had just slaughtered a dozen of his fellows, but of one who had done it a thousand times before, and would do it a thousand times again. His face was a mask of indifference, his eyes like chips of ice.\n\nHarry had no time to retreat. The prophet was already raising his staff, and the fire was already coming, a slow, deliberate stream of it, as though he had all the time in the world to kill Harry.\n\nThe fire struck Harry in the chest, and the pain was beyond anything he had ever known. It was not just the agony of burning flesh, but the agony of being unmade. His skin peeled away from his ribs, his ribs from his heart, his heart from his soul. He felt himself dissolving, and yet he did not die. The fire had not been meant to kill him, but to test him. And he passed the test, because as the flames licked at his core, he did not scream. He did not beg. He simply endured, and in that endurance found a kind of strength.\n\nThe prophet lowered his staff, and the fire died. Harry stood before him, his chest a ruin of charred flesh, but still standing.\n\nThe prophet spoke, his words like the crack of ice.\n\n“You are not of the Zyem Carasophia,” he said.\n\nHarry said nothing. He was too busy trying to breathe through the pain.\n\nThe prophet stepped closer, his staff still in his hand. The fire had not quite died from it, but was still coiling around the wood like a serpent.\n\n“You are not of the Zyem Carasophia,” he repeated.\n\nHarry found his voice. It was hoarse, but it came.\n\n“No,” he said.\n\nThe prophet studied him, his gaze moving from Harry’s face to his chest, where the fire had done its work.\n\n“You are marked,” he said.\n\nHarry nodded. He had no choice but to agree.\n\nThe prophet reached out with his free hand and touched Harry’s chest. The contact was not gentle. His fingers pressed into the charred flesh, and Harry felt the pain of it anew, but he did not flinch.\n\n“You are marked by the Iad,” the prophet said.\n\nHarry nodded again.\n\nThe prophet",
