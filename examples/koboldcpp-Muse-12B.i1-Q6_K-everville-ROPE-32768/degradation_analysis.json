It was a face of terrible beauty, the features almost too perfect, as though carved from marble and then animated. His eyes were black, and his mouth was set in a line of such sternness it might have been chiseled there. He was scanning the chamber, looking for more prey.\n\nHarry ducked behind a fallen body, his heart hammering. He had no weapon that could harm this man, no magic that could touch him. The prodigile was useless against such power. The gun in his holster would be a joke.\n\nHe heard the prophet speak, though the words were not for him.\n\n\"Where is he?\" the prophet said. \"Where is the one who came to see the sea?\"\n\nHarry held his breath. The prophet was looking in his direction, though not at him. He was looking past him, to the sliver of darkness that had opened to the shore.\n\n\"Come out,\" the prophet said, and the words were not spoken aloud, but in Harry's mind, as though they had been pressed into his skull. \"Come out and face me.\"\n\nHarry did not move. He could not. The sliver was calling him, and the prophet knew it.\n\n\"Come out,\" the prophet said again, and this time Harry felt the words like hooks in his brain. \"Or I will burn them all.\"\n\nHarry rose to his feet, his hands raised. The prophet's eyes found him instantly.\n\n\"Ah,\" the prophet said, and there was no triumph in his tone, only a kind of weary recognition. \"You.\"\n\nHarry stepped forward, his body shaking. \"I didn't come to fight you,\" he said.\n\nThe prophet's face did not change. \"Then why did you come?\"\n\n\"I wanted to see the sea,\" Harry said, and the admission was so simple, so naked, that it shamed him.\n\nThe prophet's eyes narrowed. \"You wanted to see the sea,\" he repeated, as if tasting the words. \"And you thought you could simply walk through my door and take what you wanted?\"\n\n\"I didn't know it was your door,\" Harry said.\n\nThe prophet's face twitched, almost a smile. \"No. You didn't. You're not the first to make that mistake.\" He lowered the staff slightly. \"You're not even the first to come here for the sea.\"\n\nHarry glanced at the bodies around",

The features were those of a man who had once been human, but had since been remade by the same forces that had shaped the creatures around him. His eyes were too large, his mouth too small, his skin stretched taut over his skull. He was smiling.\n\nHarry had no time to think before the prophet turned his staff in Harry's direction. The weapon hummed, and Harry felt the air thicken around him, as though the very atmosphere was being compressed. He ducked instinctively, and the blast that followed passed over his head, scorching his hair. He hit the ground, rolling, and came up behind a fallen body, which he used as cover. The prophet was advancing now, his staff raised, his smile still in place.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he called out, his words carrying an echo that made Harry's teeth ache.\n\nHarry didn't answer. He reached for his gun, but the prophet was already moving, his staff arcing through the air. Harry threw himself sideways as the blast struck the corpse he'd been hiding behind, turning it to ash in an instant. The prophet's eyes found him, and he fired again, this time at Harry's feet. The blast struck the floor, and the stone beneath Harry's hands cracked, splitting like a struck bell. He scrambled back, but the prophet was already upon him, his staff descending.\n\nHarry caught the blow on his forearm, the impact sending a shock up to his shoulder. He cried out, but the pain was nothing compared to the searing heat that followed. His flesh blistered instantly, the sleeve of his shirt burning away. He rolled again, and came up with his gun drawn.\n\nThe prophet didn't flinch. He simply raised his staff, and Harry fired. The bullet struck the prophet's chest, but instead of stopping him, it seemed to excite him. He laughed, a sound like breaking glass, and the wound in his chest began to pulse, the bullet inside him glowing white-hot.\n\n\"You dare?\" he said, and the staff came down again.\n\nHarry dodged, but not far enough. The blast caught his side, and he felt his ribs crack. He fell, gasping, the pain so intense it made his vision blur. He tried to raise the gun again, but his arm wouldn't obey.",

He drew his gun and fired, the shot cracking through the chamber. The prophet did not flinch. The bullet struck his chest, and he staggered back a pace, but did not fall. Instead, he raised his staff and pointed it at Harry.\n\nHarry had time to think, I am dead, before the energy came at him. It was not fire, but something worse: a pulse of pure absence. It struck him in the chest and he felt his body unravel, as though the very atoms of his being were being pulled apart. He had a moment to think of Norma, and then the world was gone.\n\nHe was in the sea.\n\nThe waves were not water, but something else, something that had the texture of memory. They broke against his legs, and he felt them as a thousand hands, pulling him down, pulling him under. He fought to stay upright, but the tide was too strong. He was dragged under, and the cold was not cold, but a kind of emptiness that made his teeth chatter. He opened his mouth to scream and the sea poured in, not water but absence, and he was drowning in it, drowning in the memory of drowning.\n\nThen, as suddenly as he had been taken, he was back in the chamber, on his knees, retching. The prophet stood before him, his staff lowered.\n\nHarry looked up at him, his body shaking, his vision swimming.\n\n\"You are not of the neirica,\" the prophet said, his words like the sound of a tide retreating.\n\nHarry coughed, spitting the taste of the sea from his mouth. \"No,\" he said, his voice raw.\n\nThe prophet knelt, bringing his face level with Harry's. His breath smelled of salt and something older, something deeper. \"Then why do you come here?\"\n\nHarry's hand found the gun, still in his grip. He raised it, but the prophet caught his wrist before he could fire again.\n\n\"You don't understand what you've done,\" Harry said, his voice hoarse.\n\nThe prophet's grip was like iron. \"I understand perfectly,\" he replied. \"You've opened",

It was the smile of the Iad.\n\nThe prophet had seen him too. His gaze locked with Harry’s, and the smile deepened. He raised his staff, and Harry had no time to think, only to act.

      "continuation_text": "Harry had no time to watch her death. The prophet had already turned his attention to the next victim, and the next, and the next. He was moving through the chamber with the ease of a man in a dream, his staff never still, his face never changing. The only sign of exertion was the sweat on his brow, which glistened in the failing light.\n\nHarry backed away, but the prophet had already seen him. His gaze fixed on Harry, and the staff turned in his direction.\n\nHarry had no time to draw his gun. The fire was already coming, and he had to throw himself to the ground to avoid it. It passed over his head, and struck the wall behind him, burning a hole in the brickwork.\n\n“You shouldn’t be here,” the prophet said, his words carrying across the chamber.\n\nHarry got to his feet, his heart hammering. He had no doubt that the next burst would not miss. He had to speak, to distract the prophet, to make himself human to him.\n\n“You don’t know me,” he said.\n\nThe prophet paused, his staff half-raised. His face was lined, his beard streaked with gray, but his eyes were young. They were the eyes of a man who had never known doubt.\n\n“You don’t know me,” Harry repeated, backing away as he spoke. The prophet lowered the staff a fraction.\n\n“No, I don’t,” he said. His tone was almost gentle. He looked at Harry with curiosity. “But you know me, don’t you? You know what I am, what I do. You know the Iad, don’t you? You know the name of the Uroboros. You know the name of the Beast. You know the name of the Serpent. You know the name of the—”\n\n“Yes, I know the name,” Harry said, his voice steady despite the terror in his gut.\n\nThe prophet smiled. It was a terrible smile, because it was not cruel. It was beatific.\n\n“Then you know why I do this,” he said. He gestured to the dying around him. “They were weak. They wanted to go back too soon. They wanted to go back before the blessing came. I can’t allow that. They would have been lost in the sea, and the Iad would have found them, and eaten them. I can’t allow that. I have to keep them here, until the blessing comes",

He ducked, and the blast of fire went over his head, striking the wall behind him. The heat was intense, but not lethal. He felt his hair singe, and the skin of his back blister, but he was still standing.\n\nThe prophet advanced, his face now visible in the dying light of the Borealis. It was a face Harry knew, though he had never seen it before. It was the face of a man who had once been human, but had been so long in the service of the Iad that the flesh had been corrupted, the features stretched and twisted. The eyes were the worst of it: they were not eyes at all, but a single, burning orb, set in the center of the forehead.\n\n“You,” the prophet said, his voice a rumble. He spoke with a sound like the sea, and the sea was in his face, in the way the flesh of his brow and cheekbones had been eroded by the tides. His beard was not beard at all, but a mass of seaweed, his hair a tangle of kelp.\n\nHarry backed away, but the prophet was already upon him, the staff coming down in a second arc. This time Harry caught hold of it, and the contact was like a live wire. His fingers were burned instantly, but he held on, and the prophet, plainly surprised by his defiance, let out a roar of rage.\n\nHarry had no time to think. He simply pulled the staff towards him, and as he did so the prophet stumbled forward, off balance. Harry let go of the weapon, and drove his fist into the creature’s face. The impact was sickening, his knuckles sinking into the flesh of the cheek, which was as soft as rotted fruit. The prophet reeled back, but did not fall. Instead, he raised his hands, and Harry felt the air around him thicken, as though the very atmosphere had become a weapon. It pressed against his chest, his throat, his face, and he was forced to his knees.\n\nThe prophet came closer, and Harry saw the wound he had inflicted on the creature’s face had already healed. The flesh had knitted itself back together, and the seaweed beard had grown over the damage, as though the wound had never been.\n\n“You have no",

The chamber was no longer a place of mystery, but a place of slaughter. The veils were falling, the bodies of the dead or dying caught in them, their wounds still bleeding, their mouths still open in their last cries.\n\nHe reached the stairs, and started up them, his breath coming in ragged gasps. Behind him the chamber was still shaking, but the sounds of agony were dying. He heard the last of the victims fall, and the last of the veils collapse, and the last of the light go out.\n\nTed was waiting at the top of the stairs, his face pale in the gloom.\n\n“What the hell happened down there, Harry? What the hell did you do to them? ”\n\nHarry didn’t stop to answer. He just kept climbing, his hands shaking, his breath coming in sobs. He reached the street, and the night air was a relief after the chamber’s stench.\n\nTed caught hold of him, and pulled him round to face him. His face was inches from Harry’s, his breath hot and fast.\n\n“You killed them all, didn’t you? You killed them all? ”\n\nHarry nodded, his throat too tight to speak.\n\nTed let go of him, and stepped back. His face was a mask of disgust. He looked down at the chamber, where the last of the light was dying, and the last of the bodies falling.\n\n“You didn’t have to do that, Harry. You didn’t have to do that. They were just—just—” He stopped, his voice breaking. Then, with a sudden, terrible clarity: “They were just exiles, Harry. They were just exiles, and you killed them all. You killed them all.
