Despite the appalling scale of her wounding, she was not felled, but swung round to face her wounder.\n\n“Why?” she sobbed, extending her flabby arms in his direction. “Why?”\n\nHe made no answer. Simply raised his staff a second time, and let another burst of energy go from it, striking his victim in the mouth. Her pleas ceased on the instant, and the fire climbed up over her skull, turning it to ruin in a heartbeat. Even then she didn’t fall. Her body shook as it stood, her bow",
    "ground_truth_text": "els and bladder voiding. Wearing a look close to amusement, the prophet stepped over the bloody litter that lay between them and with one backhanded swipe struck the seared face with the staff, the blow so hard her head was separated from her neck.\n\nHarry let out an involuntary cry, more of rage than of horror. The killer, who was already striding past the beheaded woman towards the crack, stopped in mid-step, and stared through the blood-flecked air.\n\nHarry froze. The prophet stared on, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\nHe doesn’t see me, Harry thought.\n\nThat was perhaps overly optimistic. The man continued to look, as though he glimpsed some trace of a presence in the deepening darkness, but could not quite decide whether his eyes were deceiving him. He wasn’t about to take any chances. Even as he stared on in puzzlement he raised his staff.\n\nHarry didn’t wait for the fire to come. He made a dash for the stairs, hoping to God that Ted had escaped ahead of him. The killing fire sighed past him, close enough for Harry to feel its sickly heat, then burst against the opposite wall, its energies tracing the cracks as it dispersed. Harry looked back towards the prophet, who had already forgotten about the phantom and had turned towards the dark crack that let on to Quiddity.\n\nHarry’s gaze went to the sliver. In the diminishing light of the chamber the shore and sea were more visible than they had been, and for a moment it was all he could do not to turn back; to race the prophet to the threshold and be out under that steepled sky.\n\nThen, from the murk off to his left, a pained and weary voice.\n\n“I’m sorry, Harry . . . please . . . I’m sorry—”\n\nWith a sickening lurch in his stomach Harry turned and sought out the source of the voice. Ted lay seven or eight yards from the bottom of the stairs, his arms open wide, his chest the same. Such a wound, wet and deep, it was a wonder he had life enough to breathe, much less to speak. Harry went down at his side.\n\n\n\n“Grab my hand, will you?” Ted said.\n\n“I’ve got it,” Harry said.\n\n“I can’t feel anything.”\n\n“Maybe that’s for the best,” Harry said. “I’m going to have to pick you up.”\n\n“He came out of nowhere—”",

The features were those of a man who had once been human, but had since been remade by the same forces that had shaped the creatures around him. His eyes were too large, his mouth too small, his skin stretched taut over his skull. He was smiling.\n\nHarry had no time to think before the prophet turned his staff in Harry's direction. The weapon hummed, and Harry felt the air thicken around him, as though the very atmosphere was being compressed. He ducked instinctively, and the blast that followed passed over his head, scorching his hair. He hit the ground, rolling, and came up behind a fallen body, which he used as cover. The prophet was advancing now, his staff raised, his smile still in place.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he called out, his words carrying an echo that made Harry's teeth ache.\n\nHarry didn't answer. He reached for his gun, but the prophet was already moving, his staff arcing through the air. Harry threw himself sideways as the blast struck the corpse he'd been hiding behind, turning it to ash in an instant. The prophet's eyes found him, and he fired again, this time at Harry's feet. The blast struck the floor, and the stone beneath Harry's hands cracked, splitting like a struck bell. He scrambled back, but the prophet was already upon him, his staff descending.\n\nHarry caught the blow on his forearm, the impact sending a shock up to his shoulder. He cried out, but the pain was nothing compared to the searing heat that followed. His flesh blistered instantly, the sleeve of his shirt burning away. He rolled again, and came up with his gun drawn.\n\nThe prophet didn't flinch. He simply raised his staff, and Harry fired. The bullet struck the prophet's chest, but instead of stopping him, it seemed to excite him. He laughed, a sound like breaking glass, and the wound in his chest began to pulse, the bullet inside him glowing white-hot.\n\n\"You dare?\" he said, and the staff came down again.\n\nHarry dodged, but not far enough. The blast caught his side, and he felt his ribs crack. He fell, gasping, the pain so intense it made his vision blur. He tried to raise the gun again, but his arm wouldn't obey.",
