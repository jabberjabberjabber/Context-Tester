Despite the appalling scale of her wounding, she was not felled, but swung round to face her wounder.\n\n“Why?” she sobbed, extending her flabby arms in his direction. “Why?”\n\nHe made no answer. Simply raised his staff a second time, and let another burst of energy go from it, striking his victim in the mouth. Her pleas ceased on the instant, and the fire climbed up over her skull, turning it to ruin in a heartbeat. Even then she didn’t fall. Her body shook as it stood, her bow",
    "ground_truth_text": "els and bladder voiding. Wearing a look close to amusement, the prophet stepped over the bloody litter that lay between them and with one backhanded swipe struck the seared face with the staff, the blow so hard her head was separated from her neck.\n\nHarry let out an involuntary cry, more of rage than of horror. The killer, who was already striding past the beheaded woman towards the crack, stopped in mid-step, and stared through the blood-flecked air.\n\nHarry froze. The prophet stared on, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\nHe doesn’t see me, Harry thought.\n\nThat was perhaps overly optimistic. The man continued to look, as though he glimpsed some trace of a presence in the deepening darkness, but could not quite decide whether his eyes were deceiving him. He wasn’t about to take any chances. Even as he stared on in puzzlement he raised his staff.\n\nHarry didn’t wait for the fire to come. He made a dash for the stairs, hoping to God that Ted had escaped ahead of him. The killing fire sighed past him, close enough for Harry to feel its sickly heat, then burst against the opposite wall, its energies tracing the cracks as it dispersed. Harry looked back towards the prophet, who had already forgotten about the phantom and had turned towards the dark crack that let on to Quiddity.\n\nHarry’s gaze went to the sliver. In the diminishing light of the chamber the shore and sea were more visible than they had been, and for a moment it was all he could do not to turn back; to race the prophet to the threshold and be out under that steepled sky.\n\nThen, from the murk off to his left, a pained and weary voice.\n\n“I’m sorry, Harry . . . please . . . I’m sorry—”\n\nWith a sickening lurch in his stomach Harry turned and sought out the source of the voice. Ted lay seven or eight yards from the bottom of the stairs, his arms open wide, his chest the same. Such a wound, wet and deep, it was a wonder he had life enough to breathe, much less to speak. Harry went down at his side.\n\n\n\n“Grab my hand, will you?” Ted said.\n\n“I’ve got it,” Harry said.\n\n“I can’t feel anything.”\n\n“Maybe that’s for the best,” Harry said. “I’m going to have to pick you up.”\n\n“He came out of nowhere—”",

He ducked, and the blast of fire went over his head, striking the wall behind him. The heat was intense, but not lethal. He felt his hair singe, and the skin of his back blister, but he was still standing.\n\nThe prophet advanced, his face now visible in the dying light of the Borealis. It was a face Harry knew, though he had never seen it before. It was the face of a man who had once been human, but had been so long in the service of the Iad that the flesh had been corrupted, the features stretched and twisted. The eyes were the worst of it: they were not eyes at all, but a single, burning orb, set in the center of the forehead.\n\n“You,” the prophet said, his voice a rumble. He spoke with a sound like the sea, and the sea was in his face, in the way the flesh of his brow and cheekbones had been eroded by the tides. His beard was not beard at all, but a mass of seaweed, his hair a tangle of kelp.\n\nHarry backed away, but the prophet was already upon him, the staff coming down in a second arc. This time Harry caught hold of it, and the contact was like a live wire. His fingers were burned instantly, but he held on, and the prophet, plainly surprised by his defiance, let out a roar of rage.\n\nHarry had no time to think. He simply pulled the staff towards him, and as he did so the prophet stumbled forward, off balance. Harry let go of the weapon, and drove his fist into the creature’s face. The impact was sickening, his knuckles sinking into the flesh of the cheek, which was as soft as rotted fruit. The prophet reeled back, but did not fall. Instead, he raised his hands, and Harry felt the air around him thicken, as though the very atmosphere had become a weapon. It pressed against his chest, his throat, his face, and he was forced to his knees.\n\nThe prophet came closer, and Harry saw the wound he had inflicted on the creature’s face had already healed. The flesh had knitted itself back together, and the seaweed beard had grown over the damage, as though the wound had never been.\n\n“You have no",
