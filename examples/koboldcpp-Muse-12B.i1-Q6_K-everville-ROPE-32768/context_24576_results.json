Despite the appalling scale of her wounding, she was not felled, but swung round to face her wounder.\n\n“Why?” she sobbed, extending her flabby arms in his direction. “Why?”\n\nHe made no answer. Simply raised his staff a second time, and let another burst of energy go from it, striking his victim in the mouth. Her pleas ceased on the instant, and the fire climbed up over her skull, turning it to ruin in a heartbeat. Even then she didn’t fall. Her body shook as it stood, her bow",
    "ground_truth_text": "els and bladder voiding. Wearing a look close to amusement, the prophet stepped over the bloody litter that lay between them and with one backhanded swipe struck the seared face with the staff, the blow so hard her head was separated from her neck.\n\nHarry let out an involuntary cry, more of rage than of horror. The killer, who was already striding past the beheaded woman towards the crack, stopped in mid-step, and stared through the blood-flecked air.\n\nHarry froze. The prophet stared on, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\nHe doesn’t see me, Harry thought.\n\nThat was perhaps overly optimistic. The man continued to look, as though he glimpsed some trace of a presence in the deepening darkness, but could not quite decide whether his eyes were deceiving him. He wasn’t about to take any chances. Even as he stared on in puzzlement he raised his staff.\n\nHarry didn’t wait for the fire to come. He made a dash for the stairs, hoping to God that Ted had escaped ahead of him. The killing fire sighed past him, close enough for Harry to feel its sickly heat, then burst against the opposite wall, its energies tracing the cracks as it dispersed. Harry looked back towards the prophet, who had already forgotten about the phantom and had turned towards the dark crack that let on to Quiddity.\n\nHarry’s gaze went to the sliver. In the diminishing light of the chamber the shore and sea were more visible than they had been, and for a moment it was all he could do not to turn back; to race the prophet to the threshold and be out under that steepled sky.\n\nThen, from the murk off to his left, a pained and weary voice.\n\n“I’m sorry, Harry . . . please . . . I’m sorry—”\n\nWith a sickening lurch in his stomach Harry turned and sought out the source of the voice. Ted lay seven or eight yards from the bottom of the stairs, his arms open wide, his chest the same. Such a wound, wet and deep, it was a wonder he had life enough to breathe, much less to speak. Harry went down at his side.\n\n\n\n“Grab my hand, will you?” Ted said.\n\n“I’ve got it,” Harry said.\n\n“I can’t feel anything.”\n\n“Maybe that’s for the best,” Harry said. “I’m going to have to pick you up.”\n\n“He came out of nowhere—”",

He was moving through the chamber with the ease of a man in a dream, his staff never still, his face never changing. The only sign of exertion was the sweat on his brow, which glistened in the failing light.\n\nHarry backed away, but the prophet had already seen him. His gaze fixed on Harry, and the staff turned in his direction.\n\nHarry had no time to draw his gun. The fire was already coming, and he had to throw himself to the ground to avoid it. It passed over his head, and struck the wall behind him, burning a hole in the brickwork.\n\n“You shouldn’t be here,” the prophet said, his words carrying across the chamber.\n\nHarry got to his feet, his heart hammering. He had no doubt that the next burst would not miss. He had to speak, to distract the prophet, to make himself human to him.\n\n“You don’t know me,” he said.\n\nThe prophet paused, his staff half-raised. His face was lined, his beard streaked with gray, but his eyes were young. They were the eyes of a man who had never known doubt.\n\n“You don’t know me,” Harry repeated, backing away as he spoke. The prophet lowered the staff a fraction.\n\n“No, I don’t,” he said. His tone was almost gentle. He looked at Harry with curiosity. “But you know me, don’t you? You know what I am, what I do. You know the Iad, don’t you? You know the name of the Uroboros. You know the name of the Beast. You know the name of the Serpent. You know the name of the—”\n\n“Yes, I know the name,” Harry said, his voice steady despite the terror in his gut.\n\nThe prophet smiled. It was a terrible smile, because it was not cruel. It was beatific.\n\n“Then you know why I do this,” he said. He gestured to the dying around him. “They were weak. They wanted to go back too soon. They wanted to go back before the blessing came. I can’t allow that. They would have been lost in the sea, and the Iad would have found them, and eaten them. I can’t allow that. I have to keep them here, until the blessing comes",
