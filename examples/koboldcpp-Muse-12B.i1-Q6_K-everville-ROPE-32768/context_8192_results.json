Despite the appalling scale of her wounding, she was not felled, but swung round to face her wounder.\n\n“Why?” she sobbed, extending her flabby arms in his direction. “Why?”\n\nHe made no answer. Simply raised his staff a second time, and let another burst of energy go from it, striking his victim in the mouth. Her pleas ceased on the instant, and the fire climbed up over her skull, turning it to ruin in a heartbeat. Even then she didn’t fall. Her body shook as it stood, her bow",
    "ground_truth_text": "els and bladder voiding. Wearing a look close to amusement, the prophet stepped over the bloody litter that lay between them and with one backhanded swipe struck the seared face with the staff, the blow so hard her head was separated from her neck.\n\nHarry let out an involuntary cry, more of rage than of horror. The killer, who was already striding past the beheaded woman towards the crack, stopped in mid-step, and stared through the blood-flecked air.\n\nHarry froze. The prophet stared on, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\nHe doesn’t see me, Harry thought.\n\nThat was perhaps overly optimistic. The man continued to look, as though he glimpsed some trace of a presence in the deepening darkness, but could not quite decide whether his eyes were deceiving him. He wasn’t about to take any chances. Even as he stared on in puzzlement he raised his staff.\n\nHarry didn’t wait for the fire to come. He made a dash for the stairs, hoping to God that Ted had escaped ahead of him. The killing fire sighed past him, close enough for Harry to feel its sickly heat, then burst against the opposite wall, its energies tracing the cracks as it dispersed. Harry looked back towards the prophet, who had already forgotten about the phantom and had turned towards the dark crack that let on to Quiddity.\n\nHarry’s gaze went to the sliver. In the diminishing light of the chamber the shore and sea were more visible than they had been, and for a moment it was all he could do not to turn back; to race the prophet to the threshold and be out under that steepled sky.\n\nThen, from the murk off to his left, a pained and weary voice.\n\n“I’m sorry, Harry . . . please . . . I’m sorry—”\n\nWith a sickening lurch in his stomach Harry turned and sought out the source of the voice. Ted lay seven or eight yards from the bottom of the stairs, his arms open wide, his chest the same. Such a wound, wet and deep, it was a wonder he had life enough to breathe, much less to speak. Harry went down at his side.\n\n\n\n“Grab my hand, will you?” Ted said.\n\n“I’ve got it,” Harry said.\n\n“I can’t feel anything.”\n\n“Maybe that’s for the best,” Harry said. “I’m going to have to pick you up.”\n\n“He came out of nowhere—”",

His eyes were not human, but they were not inhuman either. They were the eyes of a man who had seen too much and was now seeing more.\n\nHarry had no time to think. He drew his gun and fired, the shot cracking through the chamber. The prophet did not flinch. The bullet struck his chest, and he staggered back a pace, but did not fall. Instead, he raised his staff and pointed it at Harry.\n\nHarry had time to think, I am dead, before the energy came at him. It was not fire, but something worse: a pulse of pure absence. It struck him in the chest and he felt his body unravel, as though the very atoms of his being were being pulled apart. He had a moment to think of Norma, and then the world was gone.\n\nHe was in the sea.\n\nThe waves were not water, but something else, something that had the texture of memory. They broke against his legs, and he felt them as a thousand hands, pulling him down, pulling him under. He fought to stay upright, but the tide was too strong. He was dragged under, and the cold was not cold, but a kind of emptiness that made his teeth chatter. He opened his mouth to scream and the sea poured in, not water but absence, and he was drowning in it, drowning in the memory of drowning.\n\nThen, as suddenly as he had been taken, he was back in the chamber, on his knees, retching. The prophet stood before him, his staff lowered.\n\nHarry looked up at him, his body shaking, his vision swimming.\n\n\"You are not of the neirica,\" the prophet said, his words like the sound of a tide retreating.\n\nHarry coughed, spitting the taste of the sea from his mouth. \"No,\" he said, his voice raw.\n\nThe prophet knelt, bringing his face level with Harry's. His breath smelled of salt and something older, something deeper. \"Then why do you come here?\"\n\nHarry's hand found the gun, still in his grip. He raised it, but the prophet caught his wrist before he could fire again.\n\n\"You don't understand what you've done,\" Harry said, his voice hoarse.\n\nThe prophet's grip was like iron. \"I understand perfectly,\" he replied. \"You've opened",
