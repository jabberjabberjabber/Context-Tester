Despite the appalling scale of her wounding, she was not felled, but swung round to face her wounder.\n\n“Why?” she sobbed, extending her flabby arms in his direction. “Why?”\n\nHe made no answer. Simply raised his staff a second time, and let another burst of energy go from it, striking his victim in the mouth. Her pleas ceased on the instant, and the fire climbed up over her skull, turning it to ruin in a heartbeat. Even then she didn’t fall. Her body shook as it stood, her bow",
    "ground_truth_text": "els and bladder voiding. Wearing a look close to amusement, the prophet stepped over the bloody litter that lay between them and with one backhanded swipe struck the seared face with the staff, the blow so hard her head was separated from her neck.\n\nHarry let out an involuntary cry, more of rage than of horror. The killer, who was already striding past the beheaded woman towards the crack, stopped in mid-step, and stared through the blood-flecked air.\n\nHarry froze. The prophet stared on, a look of puzzlement on his face.\n\nHe doesn’t see me, Harry thought.\n\nThat was perhaps overly optimistic. The man continued to look, as though he glimpsed some trace of a presence in the deepening darkness, but could not quite decide whether his eyes were deceiving him. He wasn’t about to take any chances. Even as he stared on in puzzlement he raised his staff.\n\nHarry didn’t wait for the fire to come. He made a dash for the stairs, hoping to God that Ted had escaped ahead of him. The killing fire sighed past him, close enough for Harry to feel its sickly heat, then burst against the opposite wall, its energies tracing the cracks as it dispersed. Harry looked back towards the prophet, who had already forgotten about the phantom and had turned towards the dark crack that let on to Quiddity.\n\nHarry’s gaze went to the sliver. In the diminishing light of the chamber the shore and sea were more visible than they had been, and for a moment it was all he could do not to turn back; to race the prophet to the threshold and be out under that steepled sky.\n\nThen, from the murk off to his left, a pained and weary voice.\n\n“I’m sorry, Harry . . . please . . . I’m sorry—”\n\nWith a sickening lurch in his stomach Harry turned and sought out the source of the voice. Ted lay seven or eight yards from the bottom of the stairs, his arms open wide, his chest the same. Such a wound, wet and deep, it was a wonder he had life enough to breathe, much less to speak. Harry went down at his side.\n\n\n\n“Grab my hand, will you?” Ted said.\n\n“I’ve got it,” Harry said.\n\n“I can’t feel anything.”\n\n“Maybe that’s for the best,” Harry said. “I’m going to have to pick you up.”\n\n“He came out of nowhere—”",

It was still climbing, and as it did so, her body began to dissolve, the flesh of her face and chest and belly peeling away like old wallpaper. The fireflies that had attended her head were the last to go, their light extinguished as her skull was consumed. She fell, and the fire that had killed her ran on, seeking the next victim.\n\nHarry had no time to retreat. The staff was already turning in the man’s direction, and he felt the heat of it on his face. He ducked, and the blast went over his head, striking the wall behind him. The brickwork melted, and the heat of it was so intense it made his skin blister.\n\n“You are not of us,” the man said, his voice like a gale.\n\nHarry had no time to answer. The staff was already turning again, and he had to throw himself to the ground, the blast passing over him, and striking the wall a second time. The heat was worse this time, and he felt his back blistering.\n\n“You are not of us,” the man said again, and Harry saw the staff turning a third time. He rolled, and the blast struck the floor beside him, the stone melting and running like wax.\n\nHarry had no weapon to counter this. He had only his wits, and his tattoos, which were now burning with the same fire as the staff. He rolled again, and the blast struck the wall a fourth time, the heat so intense it made his flesh smoke.\n\n“You are not of us,” the man said, and Harry saw the staff turning a fifth time. He had no choice but to throw himself at the man, and as he did so, the blast struck the wall behind him, and the wall gave way, the heat of it licking at his back.\n\nHe was on his feet in a moment, and in the same motion, he reached for the man’s throat. The man was taller than Harry, but Harry had the advantage of surprise. He got his hands around the throat, and squeezed. The staff fell from the man’s grip, and Harry kicked it away, into the darkness.\n\nThe man did not struggle. He simply regarded Harry with a look of mild surprise, as though Harry had done something predictable.\n\n“You are not of us,” he said, and Harry felt his grip weaken. The man was not suffocating. He was simply waiting for Harry to release him.\n\n",
