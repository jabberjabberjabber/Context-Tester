The beard was familiar, the eyes, the nose, the mouth. He had seen this man before, but where? The prophet saw him too, and his face hardened.\n\nHarry backed away, but the prophet was already moving, his staff raised. The fire it spat was not aimed at Harry, but at the dying woman, who had begun to dissolve, her body unraveling like a thread pulled from a sweater. The prophet watched her go, then turned his gaze back to Harry.\n\nHarry had no time to think. He ran.\n\nBehind him the dying woman was still dissolving, her flesh unraveling in strands that hung in the air like smoke. He heard her last breath, a sound like a thread being pulled from a loom. He heard the prophet following, his footsteps deliberate, unhurried.\n\nHe reached the stairs and took them two at a time, his bare feet slapping the stone. Behind him the prophet called out, not in anger, but in something worse: disappointment.\n\n\"Harry D'Amour,\" he said, and Harry froze.\n\nHe turned, halfway up the stairs, to see the prophet ascending, his staff still smoking.\n\n\"Harry D'Amour,\" the prophet said again, and now Harry placed him. It was Father McGann, the priest who had married his parents, who had christened him, who had blessed him as a child. The man who had once given him communion wafers and now wielded a weapon that could unmake a body.\n\n\"Father,\" Harry said, his voice breaking.\n\nMcGann's face was unchanged, but his eyes were not. They were the color of old milk, and his beard was matted with the blood of his victims.\n\n\"You've come to see the sea,\" McGann said, and there was no question in it. \"I knew you would.\"\n\nHarry backed up the stairs, his hands raised. \"I didn't know it was you.\"\n\nMcGann followed, his staff lowered now. \"You always did have a taste for the impossible,\" he said. \"Even as a boy.\"\n\n\"I didn't know,\" Harry repeated, but McGann shook his head.\n\n\"You knew. You always knew. You just didn't know you knew.\"\n\nHarry reached the top of the stairs, and Ted was there, his face a mask of horror.",

Instead he raised his staff, and Harry felt the heat of the blast before it struck him, a searing line of agony from his shoulder to his ribs. He fell, but not dead. He was still conscious as the prophet approached, the staff raised for a killing blow.\n\nHarry rolled, and fired again, this time at the prophet’s chest. The prophet grunted, but did not stop. He was on Harry in a moment, the staff descending. Harry caught it with his left hand, and the pain was unbearable. His fingers burned, but he held on, and with his right hand fired again, this time at the prophet’s throat. The prophet fell to his knees, clutching the wound, but still he did not die. He looked at Harry with a look of recognition.\n\n“You don’t know me, do you?” he said, blood bubbling at his lips.\n\nHarry kicked the staff from his grip, and got to his feet, his shoulder screaming. The prophet fell forward, but still he lived, and Harry put a bullet in his skull. Only then did he die, the body twitching, the staff rolling away.\n\nHarry stood over him, panting, his shoulder a mass of agony. The chamber was now almost dark, the last of the filaments dying, the last of the light guttering. He could hear the wounded moaning, but they were dying too, their wounds too severe to be survived. The cradle was a ruin of veils and bodies, the sea beyond the sliver a distant memory.\n\nHe turned to the stairs, but Ted was already there, his face pale in the gloom.\n\n“What the hell was that thing?” Ted said.\n\nHarry shook his head. He had no answer. He had no time to give one. The prophet was not dead. His body was moving, the bullet wounds knitting, the blood drying. His eyes opened, and he sat up, his face still showing recognition.\n\n“You don’t know me, do you, Harry D’Amour? You",

He was something else, something that had come from the sea, or the sky, or the spaces between.\n\nHarry backed away, but the prophet had already seen him. His head tilted, as if considering Harry, and then he raised the staff.\n\nHarry had no time to think. He ducked, and the blast of fire went over his head, scorching the wall behind him. He rolled, and came up with his gun in hand, firing twice. The prophet did not flinch, but the bullets struck his chest and fell away, as though the air itself had caught them.\n\nHarry fired again, and again, and again, until the hammer clicked on empty chambers. The prophet smiled, and Harry saw his teeth were not teeth at all, but something like the teeth of a shark, rows of them, and he was moving forward, the staff raised.\n\nHarry turned and ran, but the prophet was faster. The staff struck him in the back, and Harry felt the fire spread up his vertebrae, not burning, but freezing. He fell, and the prophet was on him, the staff now at his throat.\n\n“You are not of us,” the prophet said, his words like the breaking of ice.\n\nHarry tried to speak, but the cold had reached his jaw. He could not.\n\nThe prophet leaned closer, his breath like the smell of the deep. “You are not of us, and yet you saw the shore. Why is that, I wonder? Why do you see what you should not see? Why do you dream what you should not dream? Why do you know what you should not know? Why do you want what you should not want? Why do you want to go home, little man?

He was yanked forward, the force of it lifting him off his feet, and he found himself in the air, the staff still in the man’s grip, the fire still licking at his ribs.\n\nHe landed at the patriarch’s feet, and the staff was withdrawn, leaving him gasping on the floor.\n\nThe patriarch regarded him with a look of recognition. His eyes were not human, but they were not wholly inhuman either. They were the eyes of a man who had once been human, and had not forgotten it.\n\n“You,” he said, and Harry heard the word in his head, not his ears.\n\nHarry tried to rise, but the staff was pressed to his throat, and the fire that had called him now held him down.\n\n“You,” the patriarch said again, and Harry felt the word like a hand on his mind.\n\nHarry tried to speak, but the fire had stolen his breath. He could only think at the patriarch, and the patriarch heard him.\n\nI am here to ask about the Iad.\n\nThe patriarch smiled. His teeth were yellowed, his beard matted with blood. He pressed the staff harder against Harry’s throat, and Harry felt the fire seep into his flesh, not burning, but knowing him. It was as though the fire was tasting him, as though it was reading him.\n\nThen the pressure eased, and the patriarch said, aloud this time, “You are not of the Order. You are not of the sea.

Then her head fell away, and the fire followed it, burning the ground where it landed.\n\nHarry had no time to think. The staff was turning in the man’s hands, and he was advancing, his gaze fixed on Harry.\n\nHarry backed away, his hand on his gun. The staff was raised again, and Harry fired. The bullet struck the man in the chest, but he did not even stumble. He smiled, and the wound closed over, the blood that had come from it vanishing as he walked.\n\nHarry fired again, and again, and again, each shot making the same impact. The man was upon him in a moment, his staff raised.\n\nHarry ducked, and the fire that should have struck him instead went into the wall behind, burning a hole in the brickwork. He rolled away, and came up with his gun still in his hand, but the man was already upon him, his staff descending. Harry caught it with his forearm, and the pain was immediate, the fire licking up his arm, but not consuming it. He was thrown back, his shoulder slamming against the wall.\n\nThe man was on him in a moment, his staff raised again. Harry fired, and this time the bullet struck his face. The wound opened, and closed, and the man smiled.\n\n“You are not of the Carasophia,” he said, his words like the surf outside.\n\nHarry had no time to answer. The staff came down again, and this time Harry caught it with both arms, the fire burning up to his elbows. He screamed, but held on, and the man was forced to wrench the weapon from his grip. It fell to the ground, and Harry kicked it away, into the darkness.\n\nThe man followed it, and Harry had no choice but to grapple with him, his hands on the man’s throat. The flesh beneath his fingers was not flesh at all, but something like wax, and it melted under his grip. The man’s face was melting too, the beard falling away in strands, the eyes running like candlewax.\n\nHarry had a moment to see the skull beneath, and it was not human. It was a spiral, a tunnel, and at the far end of it—what? A light, a light that made his head reel.\n\nThe man was laughing now,",

It was still climbing, and as it did so, her body began to dissolve, the flesh of her face and chest and belly peeling away like old wallpaper. The fireflies that had attended her head were the last to go, their light extinguished as her skull was consumed. She fell, and the fire that had killed her ran on, seeking the next victim.\n\nHarry had no time to retreat. The staff was already turning in the man’s direction, and he felt the heat of it on his face. He ducked, and the blast went over his head, striking the wall behind him. The brickwork melted, and the heat of it was so intense it made his skin blister.\n\n“You are not of us,” the man said, his voice like a gale.\n\nHarry had no time to answer. The staff was already turning again, and he had to throw himself to the ground, the blast passing over him, and striking the wall a second time. The heat was worse this time, and he felt his back blistering.\n\n“You are not of us,” the man said again, and Harry saw the staff turning a third time. He rolled, and the blast struck the floor beside him, the stone melting and running like wax.\n\nHarry had no weapon to counter this. He had only his wits, and his tattoos, which were now burning with the same fire as the staff. He rolled again, and the blast struck the wall a fourth time, the heat so intense it made his flesh smoke.\n\n“You are not of us,” the man said, and Harry saw the staff turning a fifth time. He had no choice but to throw himself at the man, and as he did so, the blast struck the wall behind him, and the wall gave way, the heat of it licking at his back.\n\nHe was on his feet in a moment, and in the same motion, he reached for the man’s throat. The man was taller than Harry, but Harry had the advantage of surprise. He got his hands around the throat, and squeezed. The staff fell from the man’s grip, and Harry kicked it away, into the darkness.\n\nThe man did not struggle. He simply regarded Harry with a look of mild surprise, as though Harry had done something predictable.\n\n“You are not of us,” he said, and Harry felt his grip weaken. The man was not suffocating. He was simply waiting for Harry to release him.\n\n",

He felt the fire in his chest, and the world went white. He was aware of falling, of the ground coming up to meet him, but the pain was not what he expected. It was a kind of ecstasy, a kind of revelation. He was aware of the staff being withdrawn, and of the prophet standing over him, his face inches from Harry’s.\n\n“You are not of us,” the prophet said, his words like the sea itself. Harry tried to speak, but his mouth was full of blood. He tried to move, but his limbs were useless.\n\nThe prophet knelt beside him, and ran his fingers through Harry’s hair. The touch was not cruel, but tender. Harry felt his head being lifted, and the prophet’s face was inches from his. He had never seen such a face. It was a face of bone and sinew, but the bone was not white, it was blue, and the sinew was not flesh, it was a kind of light. The prophet’s eyes were the same, and they regarded Harry with a terrible patience.\n\n“You are not of us, but you are of the sea,” the prophet said. “You are of the sea, and you are of the land.
