It was a face he knew, though he could not place it. The beard was familiar, the eyes, the nose, the mouth. He had seen this man before, but where? The prophet saw him too, and his face hardened.

Harry backed away, but the prophet was already moving, his staff raised. The fire it spat was not aimed at Harry, but at the dying woman, who had begun to dissolve, her body unraveling like a thread pulled from a sweater. The prophet watched her go, then turned his gaze back to Harry.

Harry had no time to think. He ran.

Behind him the dying woman was still dissolving, her flesh unraveling in strands that hung in the air like smoke. He heard her last breath, a sound like a thread being pulled from a loom. He heard the prophet following, his footsteps deliberate, unhurried.

He reached the stairs and took them two at a time, his bare feet slapping the stone. Behind him the prophet called out, not in anger, but in something worse: disappointment.

""Harry D'Amour,"" he said, and Harry froze.

He turned, halfway up the stairs, to see the prophet ascending, his staff still smoking.

""Harry D'Amour,"" the prophet said again, and now Harry placed him. It was Father McGann, the priest who had married his parents, who had christened him, who had blessed him as a child. The man who had once given him communion wafers and now wielded a weapon that could unmake a body.

""Father,"" Harry said, his voice breaking.

McGann's face was unchanged, but his eyes were not. They were the color of old milk, and his beard was matted with the blood of his victims.

""You've come to see the sea,"" McGann said, and there was no question in it. ""I knew you would.""

Harry backed up the stairs, his hands raised. ""I didn't know it was you.""

McGann followed, his staff lowered now. ""You always did have a taste for the impossible,"" he said. ""Even as a boy.""

""I didn't know,"" Harry repeated, but McGann shook his head.

""You knew. You always knew. You just didn't know you knew.""

It was a face he knew, though he could not place it. The eyes were too familiar, the beard too familiar. The prophet saw him too, and his face hardened.

Harry had no time to think. He drew his gun and fired, the shot deafening in the confined space. The prophet staggered, but did not fall. Instead he raised his staff, and Harry felt the heat of the blast before it struck him, a searing line of agony from his shoulder to his ribs. He fell, but not dead. He was still conscious as the prophet approached, the staff raised for a killing blow.

Harry rolled, and fired again, this time at the prophet’s chest. The prophet grunted, but did not stop. He was on Harry in a moment, the staff descending. Harry caught it with his left hand, and the pain was unbearable. His fingers burned, but he held on, and with his right hand fired again, this time at the prophet’s throat. The prophet fell to his knees, clutching the wound, but still he did not die. He looked at Harry with a look of recognition.

“You don’t know me, do you?” he said, blood bubbling at his lips.

Harry kicked the staff from his grip, and got to his feet, his shoulder screaming. The prophet fell forward, but still he lived, and Harry put a bullet in his skull. Only then did he die, the body twitching, the staff rolling away.

Harry stood over him, panting, his shoulder a mass of agony. The chamber was now almost dark, the last of the filaments dying, the last of the light guttering. He could hear the wounded moaning, but they were dying too, their wounds too severe to be survived. The cradle was a ruin of veils and bodies, the sea beyond the sliver a distant memory.

He turned to the stairs, but Ted was already there, his face pale in the gloom.

“What the hell was that thing?” Ted said.

Harry shook his head. He had no answer. He had no time to give one. The prophet was not dead. His body was moving, the bullet wounds knitting, the blood drying. His eyes opened, and he sat up, his face still showing recognition.

It was a face of such terrible beauty it made Harry’s breath catch. The eyes were black, the beard a cascade of silver, the mouth a wound of a mouth, the nose a blade of bone. He was not human, but he was not of Quiddity either. He was something else, something that had come from the sea, or the sky, or the spaces between.

Harry backed away, but the prophet had already seen him. His head tilted, as if considering Harry, and then he raised the staff.

Harry had no time to think. He ducked, and the blast of fire went over his head, scorching the wall behind him. He rolled, and came up with his gun in hand, firing twice. The prophet did not flinch, but the bullets struck his chest and fell away, as though the air itself had caught them.

Harry fired again, and again, and again, until the hammer clicked on empty chambers. The prophet smiled, and Harry saw his teeth were not teeth at all, but something like the teeth of a shark, rows of them, and he was moving forward, the staff raised.

Harry turned and ran, but the prophet was faster. The staff struck him in the back, and Harry felt the fire spread up his vertebrae, not burning, but freezing. He fell, and the prophet was on him, the staff now at his throat.

“You are not of us,” the prophet said, his words like the breaking of ice.

Harry tried to speak, but the cold had reached his jaw. He could not.

The prophet leaned closer, his breath like the smell of the deep. “You are not of us, and yet you saw the shore. Why is that, I wonder? Why do you see what you should not see? Why do you dream what you should not dream? Why do you know what you should not know? Why do you want what you should not want? Why do you want to go home, little man?

He had no time to duck, no time to draw his gun. The blast struck him in the chest, and he felt it burn through his flesh, not as a wound, but as a summons. It was not killing him, but calling him. He was yanked forward, the force of it lifting him off his feet, and he found himself in the air, the staff still in the man’s grip, the fire still licking at his ribs.

He landed at the patriarch’s feet, and the staff was withdrawn, leaving him gasping on the floor.

The patriarch regarded him with a look of recognition. His eyes were not human, but they were not wholly inhuman either. They were the eyes of a man who had once been human, and had not forgotten it.

“You,” he said, and Harry heard the word in his head, not his ears.

Harry tried to rise, but the staff was pressed to his throat, and the fire that had called him now held him down.

“You,” the patriarch said again, and Harry felt the word like a hand on his mind.

Harry tried to speak, but the fire had stolen his breath. He could only think at the patriarch, and the patriarch heard him.

I am here to ask about the Iad.

The patriarch smiled. His teeth were yellowed, his beard matted with blood. He pressed the staff harder against Harry’s throat, and Harry felt the fire seep into his flesh, not burning, but knowing him. It was as though the fire was tasting him, as though it was reading him.

Then the pressure eased, and the patriarch said, aloud this time, “You are not of the Order. You are not of the sea. You are of the land. You are of the land, and yet you know the sea.

Harry had no time to think. He was already moving, his gun in hand, the weapon he had not wanted to use. He fired twice, the shots echoing in the chamber, and the patriarch turned his head, his face a mask of calm. The bullets struck his chest, and he staggered, but did not fall. Instead, he smiled, and raised the staff a third time.

Harry fired again, and again, and the staff spat fire in return. It struck Harry in the shoulder, and the pain was immediate and vast. He was thrown back against the wall, his shoulder burning, his flesh peeling away from the wound. He had no time to curse the agony before the patriarch was upon him, the staff coming down in a killing arc.

Harry rolled, and the staff struck the floor where he had been. He fired again, and again, and the patriarch stumbled, but still did not fall. He was close enough now to see the wounds he had made, the blood that ran from them, the way his flesh was knitting itself back together.

“You are not of us,” the patriarch said, his words like the surf Harry had just seen.

Harry fired again, and again, and the patriarch fell to one knee, his face a mask of blood. He raised the staff, and Harry fired a final time, the bullet taking him in the throat. This time he fell, but not dead. He crawled, dragging the staff, and Harry put a bullet in his skull.

The staff fell from his grip, and Harry kicked it away, then knelt beside him, pressing the barrel to his temple.

“Who are you?” the patriarch said, his words thick with blood.

Harry said nothing.

The patriarch smiled. His teeth were black as the staff. “You are not of us, but you know us. You know the sea. You know the Iad. You know the door. You know the name of the sea.

It climbed her throat, and she was still standing, her mouth a ruin of flame, her hands raised in supplication. Then her head fell away, and the fire followed it, burning the ground where it landed.

Harry had no time to think. The staff was turning in the man’s hands, and he was advancing, his gaze fixed on Harry.

Harry backed away, his hand on his gun. The staff was raised again, and Harry fired. The bullet struck the man in the chest, but he did not even stumble. He smiled, and the wound closed over, the blood that had come from it vanishing as he walked.

Harry fired again, and again, and again, each shot making the same impact. The man was upon him in a moment, his staff raised.

Harry ducked, and the fire that should have struck him instead went into the wall behind, burning a hole in the brickwork. He rolled away, and came up with his gun still in his hand, but the man was already upon him, his staff descending. Harry caught it with his forearm, and the pain was immediate, the fire licking up his arm, but not consuming it. He was thrown back, his shoulder slamming against the wall.

The man was on him in a moment, his staff raised again. Harry fired, and this time the bullet struck his face. The wound opened, and closed, and the man smiled.

“You are not of the Carasophia,” he said, his words like the surf outside.

Harry had no time to answer. The staff came down again, and this time Harry caught it with both arms, the fire burning up to his elbows. He screamed, but held on, and the man was forced to wrench the weapon from his grip. It fell to the ground, and Harry kicked it away, into the darkness.

The man followed it, and Harry had no choice but to grapple with him, his hands on the man’s throat. The flesh beneath his fingers was not flesh at all, but something like wax, and it melted under his grip. The man’s face was melting too, the beard falling away in strands, the eyes running like candlewax.

Harry had a moment to see the skull beneath, and it was not human. It was a spiral, a tunnel, and at the far end of it—what? A light, a light that made his head reel.

The man was laughing now,",0.2319,13.8,32.45,9-10,414,30,28.44,0.3913,0.1816,0.051,0.6159,6.4536,4.0663,1.6,0.0,0.0333,0.0,1.2874,0.0966,0.4614,0.0613,-1.2901,4.0483,0.6523,0.8088,0.6523,0.0044,1,0.0,0.0,24576

It was still climbing, and as it did so, her body began to dissolve, the flesh of her face and chest and belly peeling away like old wallpaper. The fireflies that had attended her head were the last to go, their light extinguished as her skull was consumed. She fell, and the fire that had killed her ran on, seeking the next victim.

Harry had no time to retreat. The staff was already turning in the man’s direction, and he felt the heat of it on his face. He ducked, and the blast went over his head, striking the wall behind him. The brickwork melted, and the heat of it was so intense it made his skin blister.

“You are not of us,” the man said, his voice like a gale.

Harry had no time to answer. The staff was already turning again, and he had to throw himself to the ground, the blast passing over him, and striking the wall a second time. The heat was worse this time, and he felt his back blistering.

“You are not of us,” the man said again, and Harry saw the staff turning a third time. He rolled, and the blast struck the floor beside him, the stone melting and running like wax.

Harry had no weapon to counter this. He had only his wits, and his tattoos, which were now burning with the same fire as the staff. He rolled again, and the blast struck the wall a fourth time, the heat so intense it made his flesh smoke.

“You are not of us,” the man said, and Harry saw the staff turning a fifth time. He had no choice but to throw himself at the man, and as he did so, the blast struck the wall behind him, and the wall gave way, the heat of it licking at his back.

He was on his feet in a moment, and in the same motion, he reached for the man’s throat. The man was taller than Harry, but Harry had the advantage of surprise. He got his hands around the throat, and squeezed. The staff fell from the man’s grip, and Harry kicked it away, into the darkness.

The man did not struggle. He simply regarded Harry with a look of mild surprise, as though Harry had done something predictable.

“You are not of us,” he said, and Harry felt his grip weaken. The man was not suffocating. He was simply waiting for Harry to release him.

The fire that came from it was not the same as before. It was a different color, a different texture, and it struck the child in the chest, and the child was gone in a moment, its body reduced to a husk of bone and ash.

Harry had no time to react before the staff was turned on him. He felt the fire in his chest, and the world went white. He was aware of falling, of the ground coming up to meet him, but the pain was not what he expected. It was a kind of ecstasy, a kind of revelation. He was aware of the staff being withdrawn, and of the prophet standing over him, his face inches from Harry’s.

“You are not of us,” the prophet said, his words like the sea itself. Harry tried to speak, but his mouth was full of blood. He tried to move, but his limbs were useless.

The prophet knelt beside him, and ran his fingers through Harry’s hair. The touch was not cruel, but tender. Harry felt his head being lifted, and the prophet’s face was inches from his. He had never seen such a face. It was a face of bone and sinew, but the bone was not white, it was blue, and the sinew was not flesh, it was a kind of light. The prophet’s eyes were the same, and they regarded Harry with a terrible patience.

He fell, and as he did so the prophet was upon him, his staff raised for a second strike.

Harry rolled onto his back, and got his gun out. The prophet was already upon him, his staff descending. Harry fired, and the bullet struck the prophet in the shoulder. It had no effect. The prophet smiled, and struck again, this time at Harry’s groin. The pain was immediate and terrible, but Harry fired a second time, and a third, and a fourth.

He was blind for a moment, but not unconscious. He could hear the prophet laughing, and feel the staff being dragged from his wound. Then the prophet was upon him, his hands at Harry’s throat.
